# Learning-Rabbit-Mq

For this repo, it is where I have been learning RabbitMq.  This solution contains 2 WebApi's

1. Writer it will allow you to add a message to a queue
2. Reader this will read a message that is added to the queue and output a message to the output window using logger.

For setting up RabbitMq I have been using a docker image that you can find instructions here on RabbitMq website
